tasks:
1- create the menu.
finished

2-start by creating the border of the game

3-design the player

designing the player{
    struct point that have x as the row and y as the column

    struct player that have array of points where the size of the array will be 18 (18 points)
    player will have score and power

    we will start by writing a method to initialize the values of the array of points, where each point will have x and y calculated
    the first three places in the array [0,1,2] will be for the head of the ship (placed at N/2 -1) 
    the row below wll start at the index of 0-1 and so on
    the row below will start at 3-1 and so on

    we need to write a method to place the player on the 2d screen where it will take the array of coordinates and 
    start placing each one by its value.

    we need a method to move the player
    in this method we need to move up down left or right by moving the whole player at once
    this require to decrement and increment each value of the points by the same.



    we put the player in a library named player.h

    it wil contain operations on player such as move that will move the whole player 
    place player that will take a 1d array of coordinates and translate it onto 2d

    shoot which will contain a thread for the game to run while the user is inputting several inputs

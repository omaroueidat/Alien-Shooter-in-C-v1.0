# Alien-Shooter-in-C-v1.0
(Unfinsihed)
I was so excited working on thisproject from scratch after my knowledge in C and data structures
*************************************************************************************************************
What is this game about? 
  => A space shooting game where you have to defeat monsters and collect powerups. It's 2d made with C language
  
Why I made this game?
  =>I know that this game is not new, neither its effecient to do it in C language, but I challenged my self to do it so why not!
  
Why it's unfinished?
  =>The game requires threads to work. There must be parallel loops working at the same time for the user to be able to shoot and move at       the same time

Why I released it unfinished?
  =>I was proud by the job I did alone without the help of anyone, not even chatgpt, so that's the reason I released it!

What is the future of this project?
  =>I should take parallel programming next semester, and depending on it, I should be able to complete this project.
    I just hope that I will have the enough time to complete it!
